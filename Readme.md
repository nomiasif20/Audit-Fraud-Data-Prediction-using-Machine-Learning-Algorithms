How to run the code.

Run both files on Google Colab.

1) Upload the python (.py) file into project folder in google drive.
2) Run the first cell in jupyter notebook where files are mount into google drive.
3) Copy the path of python (.py) file from google drive and paste into the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file .
4) Then, import the python (.py)file into new cell of jupyternotebook.
5) Finally, run functions written in python file by using following code:

makingfunctions.c.read_file() ### Read file
makingfunctions.c.data_preprocessing() #### Data preprocessing
makingfunctions.c.plot_variables() #### Plot variables

Where, c is class object written in python (.py) file.
